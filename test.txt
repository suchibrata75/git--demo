git directory-

1) go to user directory command = pwd(present working directory)

2) register name and email address in global command = git config --global user.name "abcd"
													git config --global user.email "abcd@gmail.com"
													
3) to see my details command = git config --global --list

4) after that within our user directory there will be create a seperate text file with the name of .gitconfig.
		and the command is = cat ~/.gitconfig
												
create project-

1) to create a file = mkdir projects

2) to enter in the the project folder and see the files = ls

3) quit from my project = cd ..

4) 	create my project in my folder = git init (project name)

5)	to enter my project = cd (project name)	

basically when we create a project at first the file will be empty. but there there is a by default .git directory, which manages all the
different files relevant to git source control. the .git file or folder is hidden from the normal view. if you want to see the .git 
file then the comaand is = ls -a


1) local/machine(only my use) -> github/bitbucket/any cloud storage(all team member in project use)

2) local:
raw -> staging -> git commit

raw -> staging = git add (file name)
staging -> git commit = git commit -m "initial commit"



i -> insert/writing mode
esc -> exit mode
esc :wq -> save and exit
esc :q! -> exit without saving


to delete a file = git rm (file name)



if you want move any folder at first you have to create a root folder = mkdir (root folder name)
move your file to root folder = git mv (file name) (root folder name)



setting-up ssh authentication - 
1) first you have to create .ssh folder in your user directory, not in branch master.
2) to generate ssh key = ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email"
3) after creating your ssh key to show all your ssh file = ls -al
4) after that generate a id_rsa.pub file. copy the id_rsa.pub file. to see the ssh key just enter the pub file with an editor = vi id_rsa.pub
5) after that copy the comment from editor.	
6) create an account in github.
7) paste the comment in the ssh key section
8) after that the ssh key will generate
9) after that write the ssh command to access the github = ssh -T git@github.com
